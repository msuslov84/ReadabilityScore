## ReadabilityScore
### About:
Everyone has their own personal reading history, and as we grow up, we are able to comprehend more and more complicated texts. 
But how do you estimate the level of difficulty of a given text, and how do you teach a computer to do that? 
This program read text file by path from command-line and determines how difficult the text is and for which age it is most suitable...
### Description:
In this project I've delt with regular expression very closely. Also I've studied different readability indices
that I didn't know about before. I'd practiced a little with Sream API, formatted strings, i/o methods and JUnit 4.
